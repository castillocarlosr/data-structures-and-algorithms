# Find the index of a given value
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a linked list and display the results

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Day 01: The challenge was to create a new linked list and be able to insert new node into the front of the list and display that as head and the last node as null.  Also be able to find if a node with a value exsist.

Day 02: The challenge was to continue on the same linked list and be able to append a new node to the linked list.  Also be able to insert a new node "before" a known node in the middle of the linked list.  Also be able to insert a new node "after" a known node in the middle of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was creating a Node list.  Creating a method for inserting values to the front of the node.  New nodes would be added to where the head was and the current would become the head.
Creating a method for Includes to find if a value exsist in one of the nodes.
Creating a method for Appended to add a new node to the end of the linked list.
Creating a method for InsertBefore a new node before another node of the linked list.
Creating a method for InsertAfter a new node after another node of the linked list.

## Big O Notation
* The method "Insert" which inserts a node in the front(head) of the linked list is:  Big O(1).
* The method "Includes" which inserts a node in the front(head) of the linked list is:  Big O(n).
* The method "Append" which inserts a node in the front(head) of the linked list is:  Big O(n).
* The method "Insert" which inserts a node in the front(head) of the linked list is:  Big O(n).
* The method "InsertBefore" which inserts a node in the front(head) of the linked list is:  Big O(n).
* The method "InsertAfter" which inserts a node in the front(head) of the linked list is:  Big O(n).

### Checklist

- [x] Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
- [x] Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- [x] Create a branch in your repository called LinkedList
- [x] Create a branch in your repository called ll_insertions
- [x] Create xUnit Tests (at least three)
- [X] Pass all Tests.  Tests include Insert, Append, Includes, InsertBefore, & InsertAfter.
