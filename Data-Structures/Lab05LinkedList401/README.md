# Find the index of a given value
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a linked list and display the results

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge was to create a new linked list and be able to insert new node into the front of the list and display that as head and the last node as null.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was creating a Node list and inserting values to the front of the node.  New nodes would be added to where the head was and the current would become the head.

The Big O is a Big O(1).
