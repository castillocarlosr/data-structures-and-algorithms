# Implement a Graph
## Graph represented as an Adjacency List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Graph with following methods:
1. AddNode()
2. AddEdge()
3. GetNodes()
4. GetNeighbors()
5. Size()

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Graph representation using an Adjaceny List
- Create method for creating an empty List Graph.
- Create method for adding vertices(nodes) in the list.
- Create method for adding Edge and connected vertices to the list.
- Create method for getting all the Neighbots.
- Create method for getting the size of the graph.  Count all the vertices.

## Approach & Efficiency
## Big O Notation
* The method AddNode is: time Big O(1).
* The method AddEdge is: time Big O(1).
* The method GetNodes is: time Big O(1).
* The method GetNeighbors is: time Big O(1).
* The method Size is: time Big O(1).

### Checklist

- [x] Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
- [x] Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- [x] Create a class called Graph.
- [x] Create a branch in your repository called graph
- [x] Create xUnit Tests (at least three)
- [X] Pass all Tests.  Tests include GetAllNodes, AddEdge, GetNeighbors, GetSize, GetNull if empty.
