## Write a factorial program.

#### Coding to keep mind sharp.

### Challenge
* Was asked this at an interview.  It's been so long since I thought about factorials that I actually asked to remind me what a factorial was.  Once the interviewer told me, college (or high school) math came pouring back into my brain.

******************************************************************************************************

* Example:  
- Input: 6
- Process:  6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720
- Output: 720
