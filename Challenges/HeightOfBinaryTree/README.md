# Find the height of a binary tree.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Given a binary tree, find the maximum height.

Return as integer.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge was to create a Method that would accept a binary tree and calculate the height.  If possible, calculate the number of levels for the tree.


## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was creating a Node class that accepts an integer.  

I created a BinaryTree-Class with two methods.
Method CalculateBinaryTreeHeight would accept a tree and find the height of that tree.
Method Levels would accept that same tree and find the number of levels of that tree.

### Big O Notation.
```
The Big O of time: O(n)  => has to traverse through every node.
The Big O of space: O(h)  => h for the height of the tree.
```

### Checklist

- [x] Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment 
- [x] Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- [x] Create a method called int CalculateBinaryTreeHeight(Node root)
- [x] Create a branch in your repository with appropriate name of SnowDayDSA
- [x] Create xUnit Tests (at least three per method).  Height method and Levels method.
- [x] Pass all Tests
