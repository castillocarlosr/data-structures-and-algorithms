## Reverse a string while preserving the location of the $ dollar sign symbol.

#### Coding to keep mind sharp

### Challenge
* This is similar to reversing any string.  Except that it will NOT move the location of the $ symbol from the original string.
* The reversed string will still be reversed but go around the $ symbol.

* Example:  
- Input: abcdefg$hi
- Output ihgfedc$ba
