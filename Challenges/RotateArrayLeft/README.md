## Rotate an array left by X number of spaces

#### Coding during covid
###### Just a casual Friday
* Rotate Array

### Challenge
* Given an array and single number, rotate the array by that given numner
- Use iterative method.
- Return the new array.

#### Example
- Array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
- Number = 4
- Shift array by four places
- Starting: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
- Shift 1: [2,3,4,5,6,7,1]
- Shift 2: [3,4,5,6,7,1,2]
- Shift 3: [4,5,6,7,1,2,3]
- Shift 4: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
- New array and output is thus = [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
