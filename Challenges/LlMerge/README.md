# Find the index of a given value
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Take in two seperate Linked Lists and merge them into one.

Return as one merged linked list.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge was to be given two seperate linked list of any size and me able to merge them as one.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach we took is using the current "Current", "Head", and adding a new node like "Current" called "temp One" and "temp Two. 

The method would assign LL1-Next to tempOne and LL2-Next to tempTwo.   Then the Linnked List would be swapping places adding one after the other.


The Big O is a Big O(n).

- [x] Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- [x] Create a branch in your repository called ll_merge
- [x] On your branch, create a method named Merge(LL1, LL2) outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
- [x] Create xUnit Tests (at least three)
