## Closest Node in Binary Tree

#### Coding to keep mind sharp

* Find the closest node in a given binary tree.

### Challenge
* Given a binary tree and a value "k" find if the binary tree has the node with the value of "k".
* If the binray tree does NOT have the value of "k", find the node that does have the closest value to "k".

- Example:
Binary Tree:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 49

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp;\ &nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp;\

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;39 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 22
