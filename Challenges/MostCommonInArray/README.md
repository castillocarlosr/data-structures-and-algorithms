## Find the most common element in an array?

#### Coding to keep mind sharp

### Challenge
* Given an array, find the most common element in that array.
  - This can be done with any element in array.  Not just integers.  i.e. strings, char.
  - This method takes advantage of hashmaps (not hashsets).  Or for C# Dictionary.

* Example:
  - Input: [33, 8, 23, 67, 33, 33, 33, 8, 900, 34, 8, 8, 36, 8, 1, 23, 8, 7]

  - Output (key- the number): 8
  - Output (value frequency): 6 times
