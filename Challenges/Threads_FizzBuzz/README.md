## Threads on FizzBuzz problem

<p> In the classic problem FizzBuzz, you are told to print the numbers from 1 to n. </p>
<p> When the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". When it is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" When it is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". </p>
<p> In this problem, you are asked to do this in a multithreaded way.  Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. </p>
- One thread checks for divisibility of 3 and prints"Fizz". 
- Another thread is responsible for divisibility of 5 and prints "Buzz".
- A third thread is responsible for divisibility of 3 and 5 and prints "FizzBuzz". 
- A fourth thread does the numbers.
