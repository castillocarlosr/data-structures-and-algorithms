# Create a Multi-bracket Validation
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a console application to traverse through a binary tree using breadth first and output the node results.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
```
The challenge was to create a Method that would accept a binary tree and traverse through the tree using breadth first method.  The nodes would output to the concole in the breadth first pattern and display the node value.
```

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The approach I took was creating a method called BreadthFirst().

- The method would traverse through the tree using the Breadth first approach.

- During traverse, the node values would ouput to the console.

 
### Big O Notation.
```
The Big O of time: O(n)
The Big O of space: O(w)  w=width. 
```

### Checklist

- [x] Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
- [x] Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- [x] Create a branch in your repository called BreadthFirst()
- [x] On your branch, create a method named breadth-first-traversal outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. 
- [x] Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
- [x] Create xUnit Tests (at least three per method).  Only one method.
- [x] Pass all Tests
